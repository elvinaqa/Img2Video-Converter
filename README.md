# Img2Video-Converter
# Explanation:

Python code for converting images to video and vice versa with OpenCV lib

In cv2.VideoCapture(‘video.mp4’), we just have to mention the video name with it’s extension. Here my video name is “video.mp4”. You can set frame rate which is widely known as fps (frames per second). Here I set 0.5 so it will capture a frame at every 0.5 seconds, means 2 frames (images) for each second.
# It will save images with name as image1.jpg, image2.jpg and so on.


 Using this code we can generate video from Images (Frames). We have to add pathIn (path of the folder which contains all the images). I set framerate with 0.5 so it will take 2 images for 1 second.)
 It will generate output video in any format. (eg.: .avi, .mp4, etc.)
# !!! Please take care that all images are in sequence like image1.jpg, image2.jpg and so on.
